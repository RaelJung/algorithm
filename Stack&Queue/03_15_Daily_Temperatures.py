#LeetCode 739. Daily Temperatures

# Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
# return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
# If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        answer = [0] * len(temperatures)
        stack = []
        for i, cur in enumerate(temperatures):
            #현재 온도가 스택 값보다 높다면 정답 처리
            while stack and cur > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
                last = stack.pop()
                answer[last] = i - last
            stack.append(i)

        return answer
